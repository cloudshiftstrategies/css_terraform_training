# HCL 201

#### Built in functions

Terraform has several (65 as of this writing) built in functions that are useful when deploying infrstructure
* Offical function documentation is 
[here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html#built-in-functions).
* Some of the function documentation provided by hashicorp is terse, and difficult to apply. Ned Bellavance wrote this
awesome blog series on [Terraform Functions](https://nedinthecloud.com/2018/10/05/terraform-fotd-wrap-up/) which includes
detailed explaination and woking examples of each.

A few examples of functions
```hcl-terraform
# use file() to read a file's contents into a varible
my_var = "${ file("path.txt") }"

# use concat() to combine two or more lists into a single list.
instance_ids = "${ concat(aws_instance.db.*.id, aws_instance.web.*.id) }"

# use element() to return a single element from a list
instance_4 = "${ element(aws_instance.db.*.id, 4) }"

```

#### Templates

Terraform supports templates so that variables, or external files can be used and terraform variables inserted

Ex. userdata.tpl script that could be provided to an ec2 instance. userdata scripts run on first boot
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# update the packages
yum update -y

# Set the hostname to the public IP address of the instance
hostname $${PUBLIC_IP}
```
```hcl-terraform
# define a template_file for the userdata.sh script
data "template_file" "my_userdata" {
  template = "${ file("./userdata.tpl") }"
  vars {
    PUBLIC_IP = "${aws_instance.my_instance.public_ip}
  }
}

# Deploy the ec2 instance using the templated userdata file
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance"{
  ami = "ami-1234567"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  user_data = "data.template_file.my_userdata"
}
```

#### Math
Simple math can be performed in interpolations

* Add (+), Subtract (-), Multiply (*), and Divide (/) for float types
* Add (+), Subtract (-), Multiply (*), Divide (/), and Modulo (%) for integer types

```hcl-terraform
# create 3 aws vm instances, each with a tag called "InstanceNumber" with the unique instance # (ex. 1, 2, 3)
resource "aws_instance" "my_instances" {
  count = 3
  ami = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags {
    "InstanceNumber" = "${ count.index + 1 }"
  }
}
```

#### State files
Terraform stores a database referred to a "state file" that maps HCL resource names to actual provisioned resources. 

By default, terraform stores the state file in the project terraform.tfstate file and keeps a backup in 
terraform.tfstate.backup. Losing the state file after resources have been deployed means that the resources 
can no longer be updated/deleted by terraform (without re-importing them into the state).

As such, it is a very good idea to keep the state file in a durable location. Here is a
[list](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/index.html) of supported backend types

The example below keeps the state file in an s3 bucket, rather than in the project directory
```hcl-terraform
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "mybucket"
    key    = "path/to/my/key"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

Terraform Enterprise is one of the supported remote state backends and is configured automatically for projects
residing in a TFE workspace. 

Below is an example ofa terraform enterprise state configuration (does not have to be explicitly defined in TFE projects)
```hcl-terraform
terraform {
  backend "atlas" {
    name = "TFE_ORGANIZATION/TFE_WORKSPACE"
    address = "https://app.terraform.io" 
  }
}
```
