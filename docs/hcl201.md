# HCL201

HCL has a powerful syntax which includes some more sophisticated data types

#### Data sources

Accessing variables
```hcl-terraform
# string variables
foo = "${var.my_string_variable}"

# returns the first element of the variable "mylist"
foo = "${var.mylist[0]}"

# returns the value for "foo" in map variable "singleline_map"
foo = "${var.mymap["foo"]}"
```

Accessing other resources in the project
```hcl-terraform
# Create an aws subnet resource
resource "aws_subnet" "my_subnet" {   }

# create an aws vm instance, referencing the subnet that will be created below
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  subnet_id = "${aws_subnet.my_subnet.id}"
}
```

Accessing data resources
```hcl-terraform
# create an aws vm instance, referencing the pre-existing subnet that that we searched for below
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  subnet_id = "${data.aws_subnet.my_subnet.id}"
}

# Searches for a subnet with a filter. In this case, looks for subnet where Name = "my_subnet"
data "aws_subnet" "my_subnet" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = "my_subnet" 
  }
}
```

Accessing data from a module
```hcl-terraform
# Creates a subnet by calling external module
# This fictional module has an output a parameter called subnet_id that is set to the "id" of the subnet created
module "subnet1" {
  source = "../subnet_module"
  
}

# create an aws vm instance, referencing the subnet that was created in the external module above
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  subnet_id = "${module.subnet1.subnet_id}"
}
```

Accessing data from a count loop
```hcl-terraform
# create 3 aws vm instances, each with a tag called "InstanceNumber" with the unique instance # (ex. 0, 1, 2)
resource "aws_instance" "my_instances" {
  count = 3
  ami = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags {
    "InstanceNumber" = "${count.index}"
  }
}

```

Accessing path data
```hcl-terraform
# the current working directory
current_working_directory = "${path.cwd}"

# path of the root module
root_current_working_directory = "${path.root}"

# path to the current module
module_directory = "${path.module}"
```

Accessing terraform workspace name
```hcl-terraform
# returns that terraform workspace name
terraform_workspace = "${terraform.env}"
```

#### Conditionals

The conditional syntax is the well-known ternary operation:

CONDITION ? TRUEVAL : FALSEVAL

Example conditional operation
```hcl-terraform
# If var.env == production, use var.prod_subnet, else use var.dev_subnet
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  subnet = "${var.env == "production" ? var.prod_subnet : var.dev_subnet}"
}
```

Conditional operators support common operands
* Equality: == and !=
* Numerical comparison: >, <, >=, <=
* Boolean logic: &&, ||, unary !

A common use for conditional operators is to build resources only when certain conditions are true

```hcl-terraform
# if var.something is true, create 1 instance. Else, create none
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  count = "${var.something ? 1 : 0}"
}
```
