# HCL201

HCL has a powerful syntax which includes some more sophisticated data types

#### Data sources

Accessing variables
```hcl-terraform
# string variables
foo = var.my_string_variable

# returns the first element of the variable "mylist"
foo = var.mylist[0]

# returns the value for "foo" in map variable "singleline_map"
foo = var.mymap["foo"]
```

Accessing other resources in the project
```hcl-terraform
# Create an aws subnet resource
resource "aws_subnet" "my_subnet" {   }

# create an aws vm instance, referencing the subnet that will be created below
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.my_subnet.id
}
```

Accessing data resources
```hcl-terraform
# create an aws vm instance, referencing the pre-existing subnet that that we searched for below
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  subnet_id = data.aws_subnet.my_subnet.id
}

# Searches for a subnet with a filter. In this case, looks for subnet where Name = "my_subnet"
data "aws_subnet" "my_subnet" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = "my_subnet" 
  }
}
```

Accessing data from a module
```hcl-terraform
# Creates a subnet by calling external module
# This fictional module has an output a parameter called subnet_id that is set to the "id" of the subnet created
module "subnet1" {
  source = "../subnet_module"
}

# create an aws vm instance, referencing the subnet that was created in the external module above
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  subnet_id = module.subnet1.subnet_id
}
```

Accessing data from a count loop
```hcl-terraform
# create 3 aws vm instances, each with a tag called "InstanceNumber" with the unique instance # (ex. 0, 1, 2)
resource "aws_instance" "my_instances" {
  count = 3
  ami = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags {
    InstanceNumber = count.index
  }
}
```

Accessing path data
```hcl-terraform
# the current working directory
current_working_directory = path.cwd

# path of the root module
root_current_working_directory = path.root

# path to the current module
module_directory = path.module
```

Accessing terraform workspace name
```hcl-terraform
# returns that terraform workspace name
terraform_workspace = terraform.env
```

#### Conditionals

The conditional syntax is the well-known ternary operation:

CONDITION ? TRUEVAL : FALSEVAL

Example conditional operation
```hcl-terraform
# If var.env == production, use var.prod_subnet, else use var.dev_subnet
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  subnet = var.env == "production" ? var.prod_subnet : var.dev_subnet
}
```

Conditional operators support common operands
* Equality: == and !=
* Numerical comparison: >, <, >=, <=
* Boolean logic: &&, ||, unary !

A common use for conditional operators is to build resources only when certain conditions are true

```hcl-terraform
# if var.something is true, create 1 instance. Else, create none
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  count = var.something ? 1 : 0
}
```

Or to set an optional parameter value only when something is true, else parameter is set to null
```hcl-terraform
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  user_data = var.yum_update ? "yum update" : ""
}
```

#### Splat Expressions

A splat expression provides a more concise way to express a common operation to access elements of a list.

This behavior is particularly useful when referring to resources that may or may not have count set, and thus may or
may not produce a list value:
```hcl-terraform
# Create 10 EC2 instances
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count = 10
  ...
}
# Return a list of the 10 instance IDs
output "instance_ids" {
  value = aws_instance.web[*].id
}
```

#### Dynamic Blocks (for loops)

Loops were added in HCL 0.12. You can dynamically construct repeatable nested blocks like a security group's ingress
block using a special dynamic block type, which is supported inside resource, data, provider, and provisioner blocks.

A dynamic block acts much like a for expression, but produces nested blocks instead of a complex typed value.
It iterates over a given complex value, and generates a nested block for each element of that complex value.

```hcl-terraform
variable "service_ports" {
  type = "list"
  value = [80,443,8080]
}
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example" # can use expressions here

  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.service_ports
    content {
      from_port = ingress.value
      to_port   = ingress.value
      protocol  = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  }
}
```

- The label of the dynamic block (`ingress` in the example above) specifies what kind of nested block to generate.
- The `for_each` argument provides the complex value (list or map) to iterate over.
- The `iterator` argument (optional) sets the name of a temporary variable that represents the current element of the
  complex value. If omitted, the name of the variable defaults to the label of the dynamic block (`ingress` in the
  example above).
- The `labels` argument (optional) is a list of strings that specifies the block labels, in order, to use for each
  generated block. You can use the temporary iterator variable in this value.
- The nested `content` block defines the body of each generated block. You can use the temporary iterator variable
  inside this block.
  
Overuse of dynamic blocks can make configuration hard to read and maintain, so we recommend using them only when you
need to hide details in order to build a clean user interface for a re-usable module. Always write nested blocks out
literally where possible.
